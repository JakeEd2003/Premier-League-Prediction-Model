This is a fun little project to refamiliarise myself with creating a machine learning algorithm and using the relevant libraries.
I enjoy coding for fun and i also enjoy football. So why not combine the two! This project takes a user input of a team name (some words may be abbriviated, e.g. Manchester United = Manchester Utd) and predicts the past five years. I intend to make this predict the current season (2024/25) and see how accurate my results are.
It should be said that this model will never be 100% guarenteed as there are many unknown variables through a season (injuries, point deductions, etc) and this project should not be used for any reason related to gambling. 
Hope you enjoy!
Edit: I had to make data for Brentford and Luton Town as not enough data existed, i used Brighton and Sheffield Utd's data to combine to create some more historical data
